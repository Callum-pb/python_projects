**Sudoku Solver**

The end goal is to use OCR to read in an image of an unsolved sudoku game and produce the correct solution.

Currently, the functions for solving a sudoku game given in the form of a 2D array are working. They use a simple back-tracking alogrithm to solve.

The next step is to implement a image recognition system to read in a sudoku game to a 2D array from an image.
